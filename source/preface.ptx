  <title>Book's Goals</title>
  
  <p>
    So. . . congratulations, maybe? I don't know. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I have to assume you've been with 
    tech a while and knew that you would be the next tech head. This doesn't have as much 
    general info as the other book(How To Go On A Tech Adventure), but it might make things 
    a bit easier. Some of this book will be guide, and some will be advice. I started making 
    this second book when I realized that somethings are best mostly kept with the heads and 
    don't need to be public knowledge. I would not necessarily keep this hidden, but it 
    wouldn't be that useful to someone else unless they are about to be the lead theatre tech.

    Anyway, the purpose of this book is to teach you some skills that me and other past 
    tech leads think are useful. Along the way, there will be recomendations and resources
    given, but I'm not all knowing so there might be a better way out there. If there is 
    something better please make a pull request or use the google group linked later to tell 
    me to update it
