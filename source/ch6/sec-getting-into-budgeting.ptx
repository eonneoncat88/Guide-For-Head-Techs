  <title>Getting Into Budgeting</title>

  <p> 
    This is something I wish we would never have to deal with, but we live in a capitalist system 
    so you must know budget managment. No one likes it, but it's something we have to do. While 
    you are taking to the director about what show you will be running, an important question to 
    ask is how much money will the show cost. I don't just the rights of the show cost, but the 
    cost of new materials you will need to buy inorder run the show. Another thing you want to 
    know is how large is your ideal budget and what is the absolute maximum you can spend. If you 
    are lucky you can get away with reusing almost every single last flat, platform and prop you 
    find, so you don't have to buy anything.  However, inevitably you will need something more, 
    you might need more paint, you might need more screws, bolts, or drill bits, you might need 
    a new tool, because they broken. The point is you will need to know what you need. The easiest 
    way to do this is to keep a bunch of running inventory documents, one for flats and their 
    sizes, one for platforms and their sizes, one for current props such as swords, chairs and cups, 
    and one for the current tools/fasteners/casters/ect (the next section will talk about inventory 
    some more). I also recommend having a document with the approximate prices of building common 
    types of show pieces. As part of the materials you have in the tech vault, you should have a 
    Google Sheet that can help you out with this. As long as you know the some basic price 
    information. The piece of a new object program will need those approximate material prices as 
    inputs. Here is a basic run down of what it would for cost to build a 4x8 platform. Assuming 
    you don't need screws, you will need approximately 1 1/2inch 4x8 piece of plywood, 2 2x4 8ft 
    long pieces of wood and 6 2x4 4ft pieces of wood. This means you need ~40ft of wood or 4 12ft 
    pieces of 2x4. If it costs $38 for plywood and $27 for the 2x4x12, the total cost comes out 
    to be $146. Now, I'll admit that in most cases you will already have the short pieces and 
    normally the only "new" things you would need are some 2x4x8 pieces for the sides, since they 
    cracked while in storage. Having that a living list will make your work easier.
