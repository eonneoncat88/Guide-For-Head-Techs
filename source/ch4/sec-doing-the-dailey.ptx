  <title>Doing The Dailey.</title>

  <p> 
    As a tech head you will be expected to do additional things in order to start off the day, 
    while working, and closing. These responsibilities can be delegate off to someone else if 
    you can trust them. However, normally they can be done pretty fast, so you shouldn't have 
    anything to worry about it too much.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Unlock all the doors that will be needed that day
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on lights in the shop
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on the Vortex
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on the light and sound boards in case they are needed
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to very briefly talk with the director to make sure that everything is ok and there 
        have been no sudden changes
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a look around the stage and the shop briefly to see how messy it is and if too 
        messy declare today a cleaning day
      </li>
      <li>
        Talk with any tech member that you don't know what they are supposed to be working, and 
        if they have nothing to do assign them a new job
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure to (especially on long days) give everyone a 5-15 minutes of break every hour
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep track of the time and make sure to have everyone starts cleaning up everything 10-20 
        minutes before you want everyone to leave
      </li>
      <li>
        If everyone has completed all of their required work and you are having everyone leave 
        early, make sure to stay till everyone has a ride home
      </li>
    </ul>
