  <title>Setting Stage Assigments</title>

  <p> 
    During the final 2-3 weeks before the show if everything has gone smoothly you and the rest of 
    tech will begin doing full show run throughs along with the actors to learn where everything 
    will go. By this time you should as one of the heads should have finished deciding where you 
    will be during the show. Now the thing is figuring out who is going to help you fill in all 
    those other important roles. I would recommend having everyone try out multiple basic roles, 
    but for the more advanced roles only give them out to people you trust. The most important roles 
    you need filed are lights, sound, spots, stage right and left manager, the curtains operator, 
    and the vortex operator. Traditionally the stage left operator will run curtains and the stage 
    right operator will run the vortex. Also if you are able to spare someone to be a emergency 
    replacement to have on hand to replace any of those high level roles that can be good. The 
    responsibilities of light, sound and spots are pretty self evident. However the stage manager's 
    job can be confusing. Their main job is to be able to coordinate where various props and set 
    pieces go when not in use. They also help direct which set hands to be where they need to be. 
    In general I would recommend that this group of people, lights, sound, spots, and managers will 
    be the people you hand out radios to. Unfortately you won't have enough people to be able to 
    fill all those rolls, or maybe not have enough stage hands to have only them move the props. 
    In this case you will have to rely on actors to help out. This has caused me one too many 
    headaches from the actors either not being fully informed or misinformed on how they should 
    help out. If you are going to have to use actors I recommend using this simple 3 step process. 
    Step 1, are they cometent and will listen to your directions. Step 2, drill into them that they 
    only will be doing one thing to help out and that if they mess up you will come for them. Step 3, 
    have a tech member double check everything that they do.
