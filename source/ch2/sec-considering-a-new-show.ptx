  <title>Considering A New Show</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p> 
      At the begging of every show as a tech head you will have more responsibilities 
      than it feels like you should. It is possible you where trained in how to manage the 
      period around the beggining of a new show in your previous year as a member of tech, 
      but it also possible you didn't know you'd be someone's successor. The biggest change 
      is that you no longer will play a mostly passive voice in management during the period
      in choosing a show and in the creation of tasks to deligate. You will have to talk to 
      the director and be able to explain to them what is possible and what is not for a 
      show's. In my experience this isn't any easy thing to do, and may require some form 
      of proof as a justification.

      Broadly speaking there is three parts of starting a new show: selecting the show, 
      getting techies, and deciding on what stage elements are needed. All three parts are 
      interconnected and hard to acomplish without combining all your tech experience.
      Understanding each part will help you succed in what you do.
