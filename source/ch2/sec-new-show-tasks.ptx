  <title>New Show Tasks</title>

  <p>
    As mentioned in <xref ref="sec-considering-a-new-show"/> there is a number of tasks
    that you need to do. It is possible to try to complete all of them as needed, but it
    is nice to have a quick reference like this to show what needs to be done in what order
    to make our lives easier. 
    <ul>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 1</alert>: Discuss with the director whether the show is possible based purely
        on whether it can be feasibly built.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 2</alert>: Discuss with the director what are the key elements they would like to 
        be constructed for the show. Making this into a list.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 3</alert>: Using the list as a starting point, and the final buget of previous
        similar set elements, create an approximate cost for the show as the dirrector would like it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 4</alert>: Talk to the director about if the current estimated tech budget is enough
        to construct the set they want. If no conclution is reached go back to <em>Step 1</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 5</alert>: Put out a call to get people interested in tech to come in for a quick
        interest meeting. Given everyone that wants one the application to join tech.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 6a</alert>: Manage the tech interviews. The questions should be related to tech 
        their personal experience with tech related stuff. Why do they want to join tech or why are 
        they coming back. You'll probably be able to except anyone that wants to, but if there is too
        many applicants use the applications to make a judgement on who to cut.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 6b</alert>: For the last question you must confuse the interviewee must ask them 
        a question that make no sense and not be related in any way to tech. Say it with a poker face 
        like it's the most important thing in the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 7</alert>: Spend the first few days showing off and giving brief overviews of all 
        the tools, their primary uses, and the needed saftey procidures to use them to all tech members.
        Even if they have experience it is good to get refreshers. Make an activity out of it by making
        some kind of generic prop. Also, pay attention to who looks afraid of what. Don't force anyone
        to do something they are afraid of, that's how accidents happen.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 8</alert>: Bring the tech members to the catwalks and then bring them to the grid 
        to figure out who you can start training to be up there to get needed stuff done. If they don't 
        like heights try to avoid having them run lights or VorTek.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 9</alert>: Listen in on the actors during a show read through and take note of 
        anything they might need or want that isn't on the current list from the director.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 10</alert>: Get at least one technical script for each tech lead, and if possible 
        for the other tech members. If this is not make sure they at least get the basic script.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 11</alert>: Do a read through with all tech members having everyone take notes 
        of what they think will need to be made or could be repurposed from an old show.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 12</alert>: Compile the directors list, the actor's list and the tech list. Then
        make a approximate total bill of costs. Talk with all the tech heads to decide what is most 
        needed for the show and what is on the choping block to still have money for tool costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 13</alert>: Now knowing what needs to be made or repurposed, create a flow chart
        of who is making what and when they are doing so. Also, decide on how important each element 
        is to be able to quickly decide if a element needs to be cut for the final show when push comes
        to shove
      </li>
      <li>
        <alert>Step 14</alert>: Finally, there are only four rules you need to remember: make the plan, 
        execute the plan, expect the plan to go off the rails, throw away the plan. Follow my lead and 
        you'll be fine.
      </li>
    </ul>
